This project doesn&#39;t have new updates since 2018 (that&#39;s a long time ago) as the Antergos team, the maintainers, didn&#39;t have time to continue the develop of the Antergos project and subsequently its derived projects like lightdm-webkit2-greeter were abandoned.</p><p>Yet, the greeter works perfectly in some distros like Arch Linux, so why bother? Basically, at the time I was using Ubuntu, where lightdm-webkit2-greeter doesn&#39;t event manage to launch and I didn&#39;t want to install another distro, so... after a few weeks of trying to install it, I decided to fix it by myself.</p><p>Luckily, the project was archived so I could clone it and fix it! And even more lucky (maybe), when Antergos left they were migrating the project from WebkitGTK in C to PyQT5 in Python3 with a lot of progress. After some weeks, I managed to build the project and fix the essential bugs so it could be usable. I added more features like a brightness and battery controller, layout selector, and more... so here we are, <strong>web-greeter</strong> became a reality.</p><p>After finishing what I wanted to improve and fix about web-greeter, I decided to create <strong>nody-greeter</strong>, which became the next generation web-greeter with better performance and maintainability. Then, multi-monitor support was added along with github-ci builds for Debian, Ubuntu and Void Linux for nody-greeter. The same was added for web-greeter after some time (except for the Void builds) with an AUR package for Arch Linux.</p><p>Currently, another greeter, <strong>sea-greeter</strong> is in development just for fun.</p>',6),i=[n];function s(d,h){return t(),r("div",null,i)}var c=e(a,[["render",s],["__file","Why.html.vue"]]);export{c as default};
