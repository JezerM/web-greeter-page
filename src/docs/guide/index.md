# About
## [Web Greeter](https://github.com/JezerM/web-greeter)

Web Greeter is a LightDM greeter made with PyQt5 under the hood, a direct fork of the abandonded Antergos lightdm-webkit2-greeter project, dedicated to customization.

This greeter allows you to personalize your Linux login manager/display manager with web technologies (like HTML, CSS and Javascript), and comes with 3 preinstalled themes that you can choose from: Gruvbox, Dracula and Simple.

Furthermore, you can create your own theme with your preferred web technologies by reading the web-greeter API and some guides that are provided here.

This documentation is also valid to nody-greeter.

## [Nody Greeter](https://github.com/JezerM/nody-greeter)

Nody Greeter is another LightDM greeter made from scratch with Electron.js and NodeGTK, based directly from web-greeter with a better performance and less prone to errors.

Customizable with web technologies as well, with the same 3 preinstalled themes and the same capabilities to create your own theme for this greeter, nody-greeter is fully compatible with web-greeter.

## [Sea Greeter](https://github.com/JezerM/sea-greeter)

Sea Greeter is another... yeah, another LightDM greeter made from scratch with WebkitGTK in C, based directly from web-greeter, nody-greeter and lightdm-webkit2-greeter. This greeter should be faster than web-greeter and nody-greeter, with the same functionality; basically, the perfect modern web based greeter.

This is in development yet.
