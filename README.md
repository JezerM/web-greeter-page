# Web Greeter

This repository aims to create a web page for the purpose of presenting my web-based
greeters, such as web-greeter and nody-greeter.

Also, this could be considered as a replacement of [JezerM/web-greeter-themes][web-greeter-themes],
as this project would contain the default and community themes.

If you want to add a new theme, make an issue or a PR :D

## List of themes

- Gruvbox (default)
- Dracula (default)
